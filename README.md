## **Centroid Tracking**
Project idea obtained from Adrian Rosebrock.
My project consist of 3 .py file

**1.)ssd_centroid_tracking.py**

This is the main file which run the SSD(single shot detector) and obect tracking             .<br />
I have adapt the code to suite my usage of centroid_track.py and iou.py                      .<br />
Currently SSD detector will only run once per 30 frame                                       .<br />
Rectangle box generated by SSD will be used by object tracking mechanism for further tracking.<br />
Improves FPS of processing by running less the computational expensive SSD                   .<br />

**2.)centroid_track.py (Different implementation from author)**

The concept of this file is obtained from Adrian Rosebrock           .<br />
Due to no source code provided, I decided to use my own implmentation.<br />
<br />
  Mechanism:                                          <br />
  Calculate centroid of all objects.                  <br />
  Compare newly detected objects with old objects.    <br />
  Match old and new objects using euclidean distances.<br />
  Euclidean distance threshold set by user.           <br />

**3.)iou.py (Enhance implementation from me)**

SSD detection gives multiple overlapping bounding box for same object.                                         <br />
This is unwanted as we only need one box for one object.                                                       <br />
This module calculates the Iou of overlapping box.                                                             <br />
If Iou is greater than threshold (means highly overlap), box which has lower confidence level will be removed. <br />
This reduce the amount of box required to track and increase the frame per second.                             <br />
