## **Centroid Tracking**
Project idea obtained from Adrian Rosebrock.
My project consist of 3 .py file

1.)ssd_centroid_tracking.py

This is the main file which run the SSD(single shot detector) and obect tracking.
I have adapt the code to suite my usage of centroid_track.py and iou.py.
Currently SSD detector will only run once per 30 frame.
Rectangle box generated by SSD will be used by object tracking mechanism for further tracking.
Improves FPS of processing by running less the computational expensive SSD.

2.)centroid_track.py (Different implementation from author)

The concept of this file is obtained from Adrian Rosebrock. 
Due to no source code provided, I decided to use my own implmentation.

  Mechanism:
  Calculate centroid of all objects.
  Compare newly detected objects with old objects.
  Match old and new objects using euclidean distances.
  Euclidean distance threshold set by user.

3.)iou.py (Enhance implementation from me)

SSD detection gives multiple overlapping bounding box for same object.
This is unwanted as we only need one box for one object.
This module calculates the Iou of overlapping box.
If Iou is greater than threshold (means highly overlap), box which has lower confidence level will be removed.
This reduce the amount of box required to track and increase the frame per second.
